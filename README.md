# FIB Geometry Calculator
FIB Geometry Calculator calculates the geometry in a focused ion beam with the e-beam and ion-beam offset by a fixed angle. The manipulation needle is inserted at a fixed angle relative to the horizontal (x-y) plane. The rotation is applied along the needle with the welding point at the origin (0, 0, 0).   

To install, simply clone the entire folder: ``git clone https://github.com/matao1984/FIB-geom-calculator``. Then navigate into the folder and run ``pip install -e ./``. The pip should install the package and dependencies automatically. To run the program, type ``geom-cal`` in your python CMD window.
